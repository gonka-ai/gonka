# Testermint
## Intro
This is a framework and tests for testing the `inferenced` blockchain and the decentralized-api in local docker 
containers. It is meant to be in between raw unit tests and full end-to-end tests.

Because of the nature of the blockchain, consensus and the many connections between nodes, apis and inference servers,
this is an extremely important, yet complex, layer of testing.
