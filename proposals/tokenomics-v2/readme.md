# Tokenomics V2 Proposals

This directory contains proposals for version 2 of the project's tokenomics. Each document outlines a specific enhancement designed to improve the long-term stability, security, and economic incentives of the network.

## Documents

*   **[Dynamic Pricing](./dynamic-pricing.md)**: Proposes an automatic pricing mechanism that adjusts per-token inference costs based on real-time network utilization, replacing manual price proposals with market-responsive pricing similar to Ethereum's EIP-1559 but applied to AI inference costs.

*   **[Bitcoin-Style Reward System](./bitcoin-reward.md)**: Details a transition from variable work-based subsidies to a Bitcoin-inspired fixed reward system where predetermined amounts of Reward Coins are minted per epoch and distributed based on Proof of Compute weight, creating scarcity-driven value dynamics.

*   **[Reward Vesting](./vesting.md)**: Details a proposal to introduce a vesting schedule for all newly distributed `Reward Coins` to better align participant incentives with the long-term success of the network.

*   **[Participant Collateral](./collateral.md)**: Outlines a proposal for a collateral system where participants can stake tokens to increase their network weight, with slashing conditions for malicious behavior or failure to participate.
