## Prerequisite Reading

Before starting implementation, please read the following documents to understand the full context of the changes:
- The main proposal: `proposals/bls/signatures-flow.md`

## How to Use This Task List

### Workflow
- **Focus on a single task**: Please work on only one task at a time to ensure clarity and quality. Avoid implementing parts of future tasks.
- **Request a review**: Once a task's implementation is complete, change its status to `[?] - Review`, add a **Result** section summarizing the changes. and wait for my confirmation.
- **Update all usages**: If a function or variable is renamed, find and update all its references throughout the codebase.
- **Build after each task**: After each task is completed, build the project to ensure there are no compilation errors.
- **Test after each section**: After completing all tasks in a section, run the corresponding tests to verify the functionality.
- **Wait for completion**: After I confirm the review, mark the task as `[x] - Finished` and then move on to the next one.

### Build & Test Commands
- **Build Inference Chain**: From the project root, run `make node-local-build`
- **Build API Node**: From the project root, run `make api-local-build`
- **Run Inference Chain Unit Tests**: From the project root, run `make node-test`
- **Run API Node Unit Tests**: From the project root, run `make api-test`
- **Generate Proto Go Code**: When modifying proto files, run `ignite generate proto-go` in the inference-chain folder

### Status Indicators
- `[ ]` **Not Started** - Task has not been initiated
- `[~]` **In Progress** - Task is currently being worked on
- `[?]` **Review** - Task completed, requires review/testing
- `[x]` **Finished** - Task completed and verified

### Task Organization
Tasks are organized by implementation area and numbered for easy reference. Dependencies are noted where critical. Complete tasks in order.

### Task Format
Each task includes:
- **What**: Clear description of work to be done
- **Where**: Specific files/locations to modify
- **Why**: Brief context of purpose when not obvious
