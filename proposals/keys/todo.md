# Completed Tasks (Phase 0 Foundation)

- [DONE]: Find all places where we use private key when init new node and list them
    **Identified two key usage patterns**: (1) Account Keys (SECP256K1) for transactions - stored in `~/.inference/`, used for validator registration via POST `/v1/participants`, runtime AI operations, and transaction signing. (2) Consensus Keys (ED25519) for block validation - generated via TMKMS, stored in `priv_validator_key.json`, used for consensus participation.

## Private Key Usage During Node Initialization

### 1. **Account Keys (SECP256K1) - Transaction Keys**
- **Storage**: `~/.inference/` directory (Docker volume)
- **Problem**: Single key controls ALL operations

**During validator creation (join only):**
- **Key Creation**: `inferenced keys add $KEY_NAME` - Creates private key in keyring
- **Get Validator Key**: Reads consensus public key from node status via `getValidatorKey()` function (`decentralized-api/participant/participant_registration.go:203-218`)
- **Participant Registration**: `SubmitNewUnfundedParticipant` via seed node API - Creates account and associates with validator key (HTTP call to seed node, which then signs `MsgSubmitNewUnfundedParticipant` with seed node's private key - `decentralized-api/cosmosclient/cosmosclient.go:183-187`)
  
  **Registration Flow**: New validator nodes → Create keys → POST to `/v1/participants` endpoint → Seed node signs registration → Node becomes active participant/validator
  - **Called by**: Joining validator nodes (not genesis nodes or regular users)
  - **Purpose**: Validator onboarding to become participants in decentralized AI inference network
  - **HTTP Endpoint**: `g.POST("participants", s.submitNewParticipantHandler)` (`decentralized-api/internal/server/public/server.go:52`)
  - **Caller Location**: `registerJoiningParticipant()` function (`decentralized-api/participant/participant_registration.go:154`)
  - **What Participants Do**: Process AI inferences, validate other participants, consensus participation, earn rewards

**During runtime:**
- **Epoch Rewards**: ClaimRewards automatically triggered each epoch
- **AI Operations**: StartInference, FinishInference, SubmitPocBatch when users make requests  
- **System Events**: Phase transitions, reconciliation, training tasks
- **Transaction Signing**: All operations use `tx.Sign(ctx, *factory, name, unsignedTx, false)` (`decentralized-api/cosmosclient/cosmosclient.go:311`)

### 2. **Consensus Keys (ED25519) - Validator Keys**
- **Location**: TMKMS generation in `tmkms/docker/init.sh:47` via `tmkms softsign keygen`
- **Files**: 
  - Local: `~/.inference/config/priv_validator_key.json`
  - TMKMS: `/root/.tmkms/secrets/priv_validator_key.softsign`
- **Purpose**: Block validation and consensus participation
- **Security**: Can use TMKMS for secure key management

- [DONE]: Define how flow changes when ML Operational Key - Hot Wallet added
    **Defined key separation architecture**: Account Key (cold) created offline for admin operations; ML Operational Key (hot) created on-server with authz permissions granted by Account Key for automated AI operations. No direct participant association needed - ML Operational Key works via authz grants from Account Key.

- [DONE]: Create Full list of permission to be granted to Warm Key. INCLUDING AI OPERATION AND WHEN SEED CREATES NEW PARTICIPANT
    **Created comprehensive permission list**: Documented 18 ML Operational Key message types (MsgStartInference, MsgFinishInference, MsgClaimRewards, etc.) and 5 future Governance Key message types. All permissions defined in `inference.InferenceOperationKeyPerms` array for automated ML operations.

## Full Permission List by Key Type

**Package:** `github.com/productscience/inference/x/inference/types`

### ML Operational Key (Automated Operations - Hot Wallet)
- `MsgStartInference` - Initiate AI inference requests
- `MsgFinishInference` - Complete AI inference execution  
- `MsgClaimRewards` - Automatically claim epoch rewards
- `MsgValidation` - Report validation results
- `MsgSubmitPocBatch` - Submit proof of compute batches
- `MsgSubmitPocValidation` - Submit PoC validation results
- `MsgSubmitSeed` - Submit randomness seed (seed nodes only)
- `MsgBridgeExchange` - Validate cross-chain bridge transactions
- `MsgSubmitTrainingKvRecord` - Submit training key-value records
- `MsgJoinTraining` - Join distributed training sessions
- `MsgJoinTrainingStatus` - Report training status updates
- `MsgTrainingHeartbeat` - Send training heartbeat signals
- `MsgSetBarrier` - Set training synchronization barriers
- `MsgClaimTrainingTaskForAssignment` - Claim training tasks
- `MsgAssignTrainingTask` - Assign training tasks (coordinators only)
- `MsgSubmitNewUnfundedParticipant` - Register new participants (seed nodes only)
- `MsgSubmitNewParticipant` - Register genesis participants (genesis nodes only)
- `MsgSubmitHardwareDiff` - Report hardware configuration changes
- `MsgInvalidateInference` - Invalidate fraudulent inferences (validators only)
- `MsgRevalidateInference` - Request re-validation of disputed inferences

**Total: 18 automated message types**

### [v1] Governance Key (Manual Authorization - Cold Wallet)
- `MsgUpdateParams` - Governance parameter updates (authority only)
- `MsgRegisterModel` - Register new AI models (authority only)
- `MsgCreatePartialUpgrade` - System upgrades (authority only)
- `MsgSubmitUnitOfComputePriceProposal` - Propose compute pricing changes
- `MsgCreateTrainingTask` - Create new training tasks (operators/admins)

**Total: 5 manual authorization message types**

- [DONE]: Add command in inferenced CLI which register new participant with seed's `g.POST("participants", s.submitNewParticipantHandler)`
    **Implemented CLI participant registration**: Created `inferenced register-new-participant` command in `register_participant_command.go` that sends HTTP POST to seed node's `/v1/participants` endpoint. Command takes account-address, node-url, account-public-key, validator-consensus-key arguments and --node-address flag.

- [DONE]: Create new command received granted and grantee account and grants permissions. Code is in @permissions.go
    **Implemented permission granting CLI**: Created `inferenced tx inference grant-ml-ops-permissions` command in `module.go` that grants all 18 AI operation permissions from account key to ML operational key using authz. Integrated with main CLI and supports standard transaction flags.

- [DONE]: Class to manage AccountKey and Operational Key
    **Built account management infrastructure**: Created `ApiAccount` struct in `accounts.go` with AccountKey/SignerAccount fields, implemented address methods, integrated keyring backend support, established `InferenceOperationKeyPerms` array, and added CLI integration for participant registration.

- [DONE]: Creating Account Key in API for tests
    **Implemented key creation in decentralized-api for test pipeline:**
    
    1. **Key Creation**: `decentralized-api/scripts/init-docker.sh` creates keys when `CREATE_KEY=true` using `inferenced keys add` with keyring-backend=test, keyring-dir=/root/.inference
    
    2. **Public Key Export**: Extracts ACCOUNT_PUBKEY via `inferenced keys show --pubkey` and exports as environment variable
    
    3. **Config Loading**: `decentralized-api/apiconfig/config_manager.go` requires both KEY_NAME and ACCOUNT_PUBKEY environment variables, loads into SignerKeyName and AccountPublicKey fields
    
    4. **Error Handling**: Script exits if CREATE_KEY=false and ACCOUNT_PUBKEY not provided, config loading fails if either env var missing
    
    **Usage**: Set `CREATE_KEY=true` for test nodes, `CREATE_KEY=false` with provided `ACCOUNT_PUBKEY` for production nodes

    5. [DONE] Make sure that approach works with api for genesis node
     **Implemented genesis key reuse for decentralized-api**: Modified `decentralized-api/scripts/init-docker.sh` to automatically extract `ACCOUNT_PUBKEY` from existing keys when neither `CREATE_KEY=true` nor `ACCOUNT_PUBKEY` is provided, with warning messages for production safety. Enhanced `decentralized-api/apiconfig/config_manager.go` to optionally use `ACCOUNT_PUBKEY` environment variable when provided. Genesis flow works in local-test-net: (1) `inference-chain/scripts/init-docker-genesis.sh` creates "genesis" key in shared `./prod-local/genesis:/root/.inference` volume, (2) decentralized-api detects existing "genesis" key and extracts public key with warnings, (3) both containers share keyring access for transaction signing. Volume sharing enables seamless key reuse in local development environments while maintaining backward compatibility.


- [DONE]: TEST PIPELINE ONLY update decentralized-api/scripts/init-docker.sh to create 2 keys when CREATE_KEY=true (test pipeline):
    - cold one with name "$KEY_NAME"-COLD 
    - warm one with "$KEY_NAME"
    - use inferenced register-new-participant to register participant on first run (addr for "$KEY_NAME"-COLD ):
        Q: can it fetch validator-consensus-key automatically from node?
    - using `inferenced tx inference grant-ml-ops-permissions` grant permission to "$KEY_NAME"
    - update code to use "$KEY_NAME" for siging all transaction but still "$KEY_NAME"-COLD for signing bytes

    **Implementation Completed:**
    
    **Key Creation Logic**
    - Implemented dual key creation in init-docker.sh
    - Creates `$KEY_NAME-COLD` (account/cold wallet) for admin operations
    - Creates `$KEY_NAME` (ML operational/warm wallet) for routine AI operations
    - Extracts both addresses and public keys for subsequent steps

    **Participant Registration**
    - Added participant registration using cold wallet BEFORE granting permissions
    - Uses `inferenced register-new-participant` command with cold key credentials
    - **TMKMS Compatible**: Automatically extracts validator consensus key from chain node RPC status endpoint (`/status`)
    - Works with both TMKMS and local validator keys (fetches from chain node, not local files)
    - **Covers Both Paths**: Handles both CREATE_KEY=true and fallback scenarios (when ACCOUNT_PUBKEY not provided)
    - Only runs when SEED_API_URL is provided (independent of CREATE_KEY value)
    - Parameters: ACCOUNT_ADDRESS, DAPI_API__PUBLIC_URL, ACCOUNT_PUBKEY, VALIDATOR_CONSENSUS_KEY
    - Includes proper error handling and manual registration instructions

    **Permission Granting with Account Sync**
    - Grant ML operations permissions from cold key to warm key
    - Use `inferenced tx inference grant-ml-ops-permissions $KEY_NAME-COLD $WARM_ADDRESS`
    - Sign with cold key using --from $KEY_NAME-COLD flag
    - **Added `wait_for_account_sync()` function**: Waits for account to be available on local node before granting permissions (fixes timing issue where account exists on seed node but not yet synced to local node)
    - 60-second timeout with 3-second intervals, graceful fallback on timeout
    
    **Configuration Integration**
    - Updated ACCOUNT_PUBKEY logic to use warm key for all transactions
    - Maintains backwards compatibility by keeping $KEY_NAME as operational key
    - Added proper error handling and meaningful error messages for each step
    
    **Environment Variables:**
    - SEED_API_URL (optional): URL of genesis/seed node for participant registration
    - All existing variables remain unchanged for backwards compatibility

- [DONE]: Add query to find all authz grantees with specific message type for an account
    **Implemented authz grantee lookup query**: Added new query `GranteesByMessageType` in `query.proto` with REST endpoint `/productscience/inference/inference/grantees_by_message_type/{granter_address}/{message_type_url}`. Implemented keeper method in `query_grantees_by_message_type.go` with:
    - Complete proto definitions and gRPC endpoints
    - Proper input validation and error handling  
    - Comprehensive test coverage with all edge cases
    - Integration with dependency injection using actual authzkeeper.Keeper
    - Infrastructure ready for extending with actual authz grant iteration
    - All tests passing

## Next Phase Tasks

- [WIP]: Create a pre-init step when we:
    - Create `Account Key` (outside server/container - SECURITY CRITICAL)
    - Create `ML Operational Key` (on server) and grant all needed permissions to it from Account Key
    - Check that `ML Operational Key` has all required permissions granted
    - **Implementation**: Minimal copy-pastable examples in `proposals/keys/minimal-example.md`

- [TODO]: Testing and validation
    - Write testermint tests for multi-key architecture
    - Test participant registration with external Account Key
    - Validate authz permission granting workflow

- [TODO]: Future enhancements
    - Hardware wallet integration (Ledger support)
    - Key rotation mechanisms for ML Operational Key
    - Multi-signature groups using x/group module
