# BLS Key Generation Module Development Plan (v2)

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to develop the BLS Key Generation module, integrating with the existing `inference-chain` and `decentralized-api` components.

## I. Initial Setup & Prerequisites

### I.1 [x] Create New Cosmos SDK Module (`bls`)
*   Action: Scaffold a new module named `bls` within the `inference-chain` codebase.
*   Details: This includes creating basic module structure (`module.go`, `keeper/`, `types/`, `handler.go`, etc.).
*   Files: `x/bls/...`

### I.2 [x] Register `bls` Module
*   Action: Register the new `bls` module in the application's main file (`app.go`).
*   Details: Add `bls` to `ModuleBasics`, `keepers`, `storeKeys`, `scopedKeepers` (if needed), and module manager.
*   Files: `app.go`

### I.3 [x] Define Basic BLS Configuration (Genesis State for `bls` module)
*   Action: Define parameters for the `bls` module that can be set at genesis.
*   Details: This might include `I_total_slots` (e.g., 100 for PoC), `t_slots_degree_offset` (e.g., `floor(I_total / 2)`), dealing phase duration in blocks, verification phase duration in blocks.
*   Note: Phase durations are defined in block numbers (int64) following the existing inference module pattern, not time durations.
*   Files: `x/bls/types/genesis.go`, `x/bls/genesis.go`

### I.4 [x] Test: Basic module setup verification
*   Action: Run `make node-test` to ensure the chain initializes correctly with the new BLS module and all chain-specific tests pass.
*   Details: This runs the official inference-chain unit tests (`go test ./... -v`) and verifies that the BLS module integration doesn't break existing functionality.
*   Expected: All tests pass, including new BLS module tests, with detailed output logged to `node-test-output.log`.

## II. Pre-Step 0: Using Existing secp256k1 Keys

### II.1 [x] Proto Definition (`inference` module): `MsgSubmitNewParticipant`
*   Action: Verify that the existing `MsgSubmitNewParticipant` message includes the secp256k1 public key. Add the field only if missing.
*   Fields: `creator` (string, participant's address), `secp256k1_public_key` (bytes or string).
*   Files: `proto/inference/tx.proto`, `x/inference/types/tx.pb.go`
*   Important: When verifying, check all existing key-related fields even if they have different names (e.g., `validator_key`, `pub_key`, `public_key`) to see if any contain the needed secp256k1 key format. If the field already exists with proper validation, add a note with the name of the field, and update task status to complete without code changes.
*   Note: ✅ The `Participant` type stored by the inference module contains a `ValidatorKey` field. However, for DKG operations requiring a secp256k1 public key, the system now uses the participant's account public key, which is obtained from the `AccountKeeper` using the participant's address (which is the `Index` field of an `ActiveParticipant` during DKG initiation). This account public key is the one the `decentralized-api` possesses and uses for cryptographic operations related to DKG. 

### II.2 [x] Chain-Side Handler (`inference` module): Verify `SubmitNewParticipant`
*   Action: Ensure the handler for `MsgSubmitNewParticipant` properly stores the secp256k1 public key.
*   Logic:
    *   Authenticate sender (`creator`).
    *   Store participant data including the secp256k1 public key.
*   Files: `x/inference/keeper/msg_server_submit_new_participant.go`
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** Handler verified working correctly - authenticates sender via `msg.GetCreator()` and stores secp256k1 public key via `ValidatorKey: msg.GetValidatorKey()` in the `Participant` struct.

### II.3 [x] Controller-Side (`decentralized-api`): Use Existing secp256k1 Key
*   Action: Ensure the controller uses its existing secp256k1 key for DKG operations.
*   Logic: When gathering data for `MsgSubmitNewParticipant`, use the existing secp256k1 public key.
*   Files: `decentralized-api/participant_registration/participant_registration.go`
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** Controller verified working correctly - uses `getValidatorKey()` to retrieve secp256k1 public key from Tendermint RPC (`result.ValidatorInfo.PubKey`) and properly encodes it as `ValidatorKey` field in both `registerGenesisParticipant()` and `registerJoiningParticipant()` functions.

### II.4 [x] Test
*   Action: Create unit tests for the `SubmitNewParticipant` message handler in the `inference` module.
*   Action: Create integration tests where a controller registers using its secp256k1 key and verify chain state.
*   Action: Test the controller's usage of its account public key for DKG-related cryptographic operations.
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** Enhanced existing tests in `msg_server_submit_new_participant_test.go` with comprehensive testing:
    *   `TestMsgServer_SubmitNewParticipant`: Tests full participant creation, including the storage and validation of fields like `ValidatorKey` if it is intended to be a secp256k1 public key for non-DKG purposes or general identification.
    *   `TestMsgServer_SubmitNewParticipant_WithEmptyKeys`: Tests graceful handling of empty key fields during participant registration.
    *   `TestMsgServer_SubmitNewParticipant_ValidateSecp256k1Key`: Tests specific secp256k1 key validation logic for fields like `ValidatorKey` during participant registration, if applicable.
    *   (Note: Separate integration tests, like those in `bls_integration_test.go` (Section III.5), verify that DKG operations correctly use the account public key obtained from `AccountKeeper`.)
    *   All 359 chain tests still pass, confirming no regressions were introduced.
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** Controller tests verified: 
    *   All 56 decentralized-api tests pass via `make api-test`, including participant registration functionality.
    *   DKG-related cryptographic operations in the controller (e.g., `dealer.go`) have been updated and tested to use the account public key (obtained via chain events carrying compressed secp256k1 keys) for ECIES encryption, aligning with the keys managed by `AccountKeeper` on the chain side.

## III. Step 1: DKG Initiation (On-Chain `bls` and `inference` modules)

### III.1 [x] Proto Definition (`bls` module): `EpochBLSData`
*   Action: Define `EpochBLSData` Protobuf message.
*   Fields:
    *   `epoch_id` (uint64)
    *   `i_total_slots` (uint32)
    *   `t_slots_degree` (uint32) // Polynomial degree `t`
    *   `participants` (repeated `BLSParticipantInfo`)
        *   `BLSParticipantInfo`: `address` (string), `percentage_weight` (string/sdk.Dec), `secp256k1_public_key` (bytes), `slot_start_index` (uint32), `slot_end_index` (uint32)  // secp256k1_public_key is the account's compressed public key
    *   `dkg_phase` (enum: `UNDEFINED`, `DEALING`, `VERIFYING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`)
    *   `dealing_phase_deadline_block` (int64) // Block height deadline, not duration
    *   `verifying_phase_deadline_block` (int64) // Block height deadline, not duration
    *   `group_public_key` (bytes, G2 point)
    *   `dealer_parts` (repeated DealerPartStorage) // Array indexed by participant order
        *   `DealerPartStorage`: `dealer_address` (string), `commitments` (repeated bytes), `participant_shares` (repeated EncryptedSharesForParticipant) // Index i = shares for participants[i]
        *   `EncryptedSharesForParticipant`: `encrypted_shares` (repeated bytes) // Index i = share for slot (participant.slot_start_index + i)
    *   `verification_vectors_submitters` (repeated string) // list of addresses who submitted verification vectors
*   Files: `proto/bls/types.proto`, `x/bls/types/types.pb.go`
*   Important: All structures use deterministic repeated arrays with direct indexing. `dealer_parts` array index matches `participants` array index. `participant_shares` array index i contains shares for `participants[i]`.
*   Note: ✅ Created complete protobuf definitions in `proto/inference/bls/types.proto` with simplified deterministic structures:
    *   `DKGPhase` enum with all phases (`UNDEFINED`, `DEALING`, `VERIFYING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`)
    *   `BLSParticipantInfo` with address, weight (sdk.Dec), secp256k1 key, and slot indices
    *   `EncryptedSharesForParticipant` with `repeated bytes encrypted_shares` where index i = share for slot (participant.slot_start_index + i)
    *   `DealerPartStorage` with `repeated EncryptedSharesForParticipant participant_shares` where index i = shares for participants[i]
    *   `EpochBLSData` with all specified fields using deterministic array indexing
    *   Eliminated all map usage for consensus safety - uses direct array indexing throughout

### III.2 [x] Proto Definition (`bls` module): `EventKeyGenerationInitiated`
*   Action: Define `EventKeyGenerationInitiated` Protobuf message for events.
*   Fields: `epoch_id` (uint64), `i_total_slots` (uint32), `t_slots_degree` (uint32), `participants` (repeated `BLSParticipantInfo`).
*   Files: `proto/bls/events.proto`, `x/bls/types/events.pb.go`
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** Created `proto/inference/bls/events.proto` with `EventKeyGenerationInitiated` event containing:
    *   `epoch_id` (uint64) - unique DKG round identifier
    *   `i_total_slots` (uint32) - total number of DKG slots
    *   `t_slots_degree` (uint32) - polynomial degree for threshold scheme
    *   `participants` (repeated BLSParticipantInfo) - complete participant info with slots and keys
    *   Generated Go code successfully (12KB events.pb.go), all 359 chain tests pass.

### III.3 [x] `bls` Module Keeper: `InitiateKeyGenerationForEpoch` Function
*   Action: Implement `InitiateKeyGenerationForEpoch` in `x/bls/keeper/dkg_initiation.go` (or `keeper.go`).
*   Signature: `func (k Keeper) InitiateKeyGenerationForEpoch(ctx sdk.Context, epochID uint64, finalizedParticipants []inferencekeeper.ParticipantWithWeightAndKey) error`
    *   `ParticipantWithWeightAndKey`: A temporary struct/type passed from `inference` module, containing `address`, `percentage_weight`, `secp256k1_public_key` (this is the account's compressed public key).
*   Logic:
    *   Authenticate caller (e.g., ensure it's called by the `inference` module by checking capabilities or a pre-defined authority).
    *   Retrieve `I_total_slots` and calculate `t_slots_degree` from module params.
    *   Perform deterministic slot assignment based on `percentage_weight` to populate `slot_start_index` and `slot_end_index` for each participant. Ensure all slots are assigned proportionally and without overlap.
    *   Create and store `EpochBLSData` for `epochID`.
    *   Set `dkg_phase` to `DEALING`.
    *   Calculate and set `dealing_phase_deadline_block` based on current block height and configured duration.
    *   Emit `EventKeyGenerationInitiated` using `sdk.EventManager`.
*   Files: `x/bls/keeper/dkg_initiation.go`, `x/bls/keeper/keeper.go`
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Function implemented with:
    *   `ParticipantWithWeightAndKey` struct defined locally in keeper package
    *   Deterministic slot assignment with proper weight-based distribution 
    *   `AssignSlots` helper function with comprehensive test coverage
    *   `EpochBLSData` creation and storage with proper deadline calculations
    *   Event emission for `EventKeyGenerationInitiated`
    *   Full unit test coverage for slot assignment edge cases
    *   All tests passing

### III.4 [x] `inference` Module Modification: Call `InitiateKeyGenerationForEpoch`
*   Action: In the `inference` module's `EndBlock` logic, after `onSetNewValidatorsStage` successfully completes.
*   Logic:
    *   Gather the `finalized_validator_set_with_weights`. For each participant, their secp256k1 public key is fetched from `AccountKeeper` using their address.
    *   Make an internal call to `blsKeeper.InitiateKeyGenerationForEpoch(ctx, nextEpochID, finalized_validator_set_with_weights_and_keys)`.
*   Files: `x/inference/module/module.go` (or where `EndBlock` logic resides), `x/inference/keeper/keeper.go` (to add dependency on `blsKeeper`).
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** Integration implemented successfully:
    *   Added `BlsKeeper` field to inference keeper with proper dependency injection
    *   Updated `ModuleInputs` and `ProvideModule` to include BLS keeper dependency
    *   Implemented `initiateBLSKeyGeneration` function in inference module that:
        *   Converts `ActiveParticipant` data to `ParticipantWithWeightAndKey` format
        *   Calculates percentage weights from absolute weights
        *   Decodes base64-encoded secp256k1 public keys
        *   Calls `BlsKeeper.InitiateKeyGenerationForEpoch` with proper context conversion
    *   Added call to `initiateBLSKeyGeneration` at end of `onSetNewValidatorsStage`
    *   Updated test utilities to include BLS keeper for testing
    *   Created comprehensive integration tests verifying:
        *   Successful BLS key generation with valid participants
        *   Proper handling of empty participant lists
        *   Graceful error handling for invalid secp256k1 keys
        *   Correct data conversion and slot assignment
    *   All 359+ chain tests pass, confirming no regressions introduced

### III.5 [x] End-to-End Epoch Transition Integration Test
*   Action: Create comprehensive integration test that simulates complete epoch transition and verifies inference module successfully triggers BLS key generation.
*   Action: Implement `TestCompleteEpochTransitionWithBLS` function that:
    *   Sets up realistic epoch conditions (participants with their account public keys (obtained from `AccountKeeper` using `Creator` address - this is the key `decentralized-api` possesses), epoch params, block heights).
    *   Sets up epoch group data and upcoming epoch group.
    *   Calls `onSetNewValidatorsStage()` (the real entry point for epoch transition).
    *   Verifies complete integration (ActiveParticipants storage + BLS initiation).
    *   Tests error scenarios (missing participants, invalid account public keys, epoch transition failures).
*   Action: Create helper functions for test setup (participants, epoch data, etc.).
*   Action: Verify test covers full data flow: epoch transition → participant conversion → BLS key generation → EpochBLSData creation.
*   Action: Ensure test validates error handling and logging verification.
*   Action: Run test to confirm inference → BLS integration works end-to-end before proceeding to dealing phase.
*   Files: `x/inference/module/bls_integration_test.go` (new file).
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created comprehensive end-to-end integration tests that validate complete inference → BLS integration:
    *   `TestCompleteEpochTransitionWithBLS`: Tests complete BLS integration flow with account public key (from `Creator` via `AccountKeeper`) validation.
    *   `TestBLSIntegrationWithMissingParticipants`: Tests error handling for missing participants from store.
    *   `TestBLSIntegrationWithInvalidAccountKeys`: Tests error handling for invalid base64 account public keys.
    *   Tests explicitly verify account public key usage (the one `decentralized-api` has, not ValidatorKey) with proper key type validation.
    *   Comprehensive error scenarios with graceful failure handling and proper logging
    *   All 373 chain tests pass, confirming integration works without regressions

## IV. Step 2: Dealing Phase

### IV.1 [x] Proto Definition (`bls` module): `MsgSubmitDealerPart` and `EventDealerPartSubmitted`
*   Action: Define `MsgSubmitDealerPart` transaction message and `EventDealerPartSubmitted` event.
*   `MsgSubmitDealerPart`: `creator` (string), `epoch_id` (uint64), `commitments` (repeated bytes), `encrypted_shares_for_participants` (repeated EncryptedSharesForParticipant)
*   `EventDealerPartSubmitted`: `epoch_id` (uint64), `dealer_address` (string)
*   Files: `proto/inference/bls/tx.proto` (add MsgSubmitDealerPart), `proto/inference/bls/events.proto` (add EventDealerPartSubmitted)
*   Important: Message uses direct array indexing where index i corresponds to `EpochBLSData.participants[i]`. No address lookups or sorting needed.
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All protobuf definitions implemented and Go code generated successfully:
    *   ✅ `MsgSubmitDealerPart` message added to `tx.proto` with proper fields and annotations
    *   ✅ `EventDealerPartSubmitted` event added to `events.proto` 
    *   ✅ Go code generated successfully with `ignite generate proto-go`
    *   ✅ RPC service definitions generated correctly
    *   ✅ Types package tests pass confirming no regressions

### IV.2 [x] Controller-Side Logic (`decentralized-api`): Dealing
*   Action: Implement dealer logic to listen for `EventKeyGenerationInitiated` and submit `MsgSubmitDealerPart`.
*   Location: `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/dealer.go` (new package/file).
*   Logic:
    *   Listen for `EventKeyGenerationInitiated` from the `bls` module via chain event listener.
    *   If the controller is a participant in the DKG for `epoch_id`:
        *   Parse `I_total_slots`, `t_slots_degree`, and the list of all participants with their slot ranges and their account secp256k1 public keys (compressed format from the event).
        *   Generate its secret BLS polynomial `Poly_k(x)` of degree `t_slots_degree`. (Requires BLS library).
        *   Compute public commitments to coefficients (`C_kj = g * a_kj`, G2 points).
        *   For each *other* participating controller `P_m` (and their slot range `[start_m, end_m]`):
            *   For each slot index `i` in `P_m`'s range:
                *   Compute scalar share `share_ki = Poly_k(i)`.
                *   Encrypt `share_ki` using `P_m`'s secp256k1 public key with ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme). This involves:
                    *   Generate an ephemeral key pair
                    *   Perform ECDH key agreement
                    *   Derive a symmetric key
                    *   Encrypt the share using the derived key
                *   The resulting `encrypted_share_ki_for_m` contains both the ephemeral public key and the encrypted data.
        *   Construct `MsgSubmitDealerPart` with commitments and all encrypted shares in participant order.
        *   Create `encrypted_shares_for_participants` array with length = len(participants).
        *   For each participant at index i, compute and store their shares at `encrypted_shares_for_participants[i]`.
        *   Submit `MsgSubmitDealerPart` to the `bls` module via `cosmosClient`.
*   Files: `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/dealer.go` (new), `decentralized-api/internal/event_listener/event_listener.go` (modify), `decentralized-api/cosmosclient/cosmosclient.go` (add SubmitDealerPart method), `decentralized-api/main.go` (integrate dealer)
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented complete dealer logic:
    *   ✅ Created `Dealer` struct with `ProcessKeyGenerationInitiated` method
    *   ✅ Added event subscription for `key_generation_initiated.epoch_id EXISTS` 
    *   ✅ Added BLS event handling in event listener (checks before message.action)
    *   ✅ Added `SubmitDealerPart` method to `CosmosMessageClient` interface and implementation
    *   ✅ Integrated dealer into main.go with proper dependency injection
    *   ✅ Placeholder cryptography structure ready for BLS implementation
    *   ✅ Proper participant validation and slot-based share generation logic
    *   Note: Full compilation blocked by missing chain-side handler (Step IV.3)

### IV.2.1 [x] BLS Cryptography Library Integration (`decentralized-api`)
*   Action: Integrate Consensys/gnark-crypto library to replace placeholder cryptographic functions in dealer logic.
*   Libraries: 
    *   `github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto` (BLS12-381 operations with production audit reports, excellent performance, IETF standards compliance)
    *   `github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v4` (Cosmos-compatible secp256k1 operations)
    *   `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/crypto/ecies` (Cosmos SDK ECIES implementation)
*   Integration Points: Replace placeholders in `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/dealer.go`:
    *   `generateRandomPolynomial(degree uint32) []*fr.Element` - Generate random polynomial coefficients
    *   `computeG2Commitments(coefficients []*fr.Element) []bls12381.G2Affine` - Compute G2 commitments  
    *   `evaluatePolynomial(polynomial []*fr.Element, x uint32) *fr.Element` - Evaluate polynomial at x
    *   `encryptForParticipant(data []byte, secp256k1PubKeyBytes []byte) ([]byte, error)` - Encrypt using Cosmos-compatible ECIES (standalone function)
*   Dependencies: Add dependencies to `decentralized-api/go.mod`: `github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto`, `github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v4`
*   Imports: 
    *   `"github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto/ecc/bls12-381"` and `"github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto/ecc/bls12-381/fr"`
    *   `"github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v4"` and `"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/crypto/ecies"`
*   **Compatibility Achieved**: Dealer encryption ↔ Cosmos keyring decryption verified working through comprehensive testing.
*   Files: `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/dealer.go` (replace placeholder functions), `decentralized-api/go.mod` (add dependency).
*   Testing: Unit tests for cryptographic operations with real BLS12-381 operations.
*   Important: BLS12-381 provides ~126-bit security (preferred over BN254 for long-term security). Used by major Ethereum projects with proven reliability.
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented all BLS cryptographic operations with **Cosmos-native ECIES**:
    *   ✅ Added gnark-crypto, decred secp256k1, and Cosmos SDK ECIES dependencies
    *   ✅ Implemented `generateRandomPolynomial`, `computeG2Commitments`, `evaluatePolynomial` with real cryptography
    *   ✅ Implemented `encryptForParticipant` using Decred secp256k1 + Cosmos SDK ECIES for **perfect dealer ↔ keyring compatibility**
    *   ✅ **Eliminated Ethereum dependencies** (`go mod tidy` confirms `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` unused)
    *   ✅ **Verified Compatibility**: Comprehensive tests confirm dealer encryption ↔ Cosmos keyring decryption works flawlessly
    *   ✅ All 400+ chain tests + 78 API tests pass, confirming system-wide compatibility
    *   ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all cryptographic operations
    *   ✅ **OPTIMIZATION**: Switched from uncompressed G2 format (192 bytes) to compressed G2 format (96 bytes) for 50% storage reduction - ideal for blockchain applications
*   Note: ✅ **INTEGRATION COMPLETE** - Chain-side handler (IV.3) now implemented, full project compilation successful.

### IV.3 [x] Chain-Side Handler (`bls` module): `SubmitDealerPart` in `msg_server.go`
*   Action: Implement the gRPC message handler for `MsgSubmitDealerPart`.
*   Location: `x/bls/keeper/msg_server_dealer.go`.
*   Logic:
    *   Retrieve `EpochBLSData` for `msg.epoch_id`.
    *   Verify:
        *   Sender (`msg.creator`) is a registered participant for this DKG round in `EpochBLSData`.
        *   Current DKG phase is `DEALING`.
        *   Current block height is before `dealing_phase_deadline_block`.
        *   Dealer has not submitted their part already.
    *   Find the participant index in `EpochBLSData.participants` array for `msg.creator`.
    *   Convert `MsgSubmitDealerPart` to `DealerPartStorage` format:
        *   Verify array length: `len(msg.encrypted_shares_for_participants) == len(EpochBLSData.participants)`.
        *   Direct copy: `participant_shares = msg.encrypted_shares_for_participants` (indices already match).
    *   Store `DealerPartStorage` into `EpochBLSData.dealer_parts[participant_index]` (array position matching participant order).
    *   Emit `EventDealerPartSubmitted`.
*   Files: `x/bls/keeper/msg_server_dealer.go`.
*   Important: Message and storage use identical array indexing. Conversion is a simple array copy with length validation. No address lookups or sorting required.
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented complete `SubmitDealerPart` message handler:
    *   ✅ Created `msg_server_dealer.go` with full gRPC handler implementation
    *   ✅ Comprehensive validation logic: epoch existence, DKG phase (DEALING), deadline enforcement, participant verification, duplicate submission prevention
    *   ✅ Encrypted shares array length validation matching participant count
    *   ✅ Deterministic data conversion from `MsgSubmitDealerPart` to `DealerPartStorage` format with proper array indexing
    *   ✅ Correct storage in `EpochBLSData.dealer_parts[participant_index]` with participant order preservation
    *   ✅ Proper `EventDealerPartSubmitted` protobuf event emission with epoch and dealer information
    *   ✅ Full integration with existing BLS module infrastructure and keeper patterns

### IV.4 [x] Test
*   Action: Controller: Unit tests for polynomial generation, commitment calculation, share encryption, and `MsgSubmitDealerPart` construction. (Mock BLS and ECIES libraries).
*   Action: Chain: Unit tests for `SubmitDealerPart` handler (validations, data storage, event emission).
*   Action: Integration Test: A controller (as dealer) listens for `EventKeyGenerationInitiated`, prepares, and submits `MsgSubmitDealerPart`. Chain validates and stores it. Check `EpochBLSData` on chain.
*   Action: Run tests.
*   Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive test suite implemented and passing:
    *   ✅ **Chain-side Tests** (`msg_server_dealer_test.go` - 8 new tests):
        *   `TestSubmitDealerPart_Success`: Full success case with complete data storage verification

        *   `TestPolynomialGeneration`: Polynomial generation with various degrees (1, 10, 100)
        *   `TestCommitmentCalculation`: G2 commitment calculation verification with compressed format (96 bytes)
        *   `TestShareEncryption`: ECIES share encryption testing with valid secp256k1 keys
        *   `TestInvalidPublicKeyEncryption`: Invalid public key error handling (empty, too short/long, invalid prefix)
        *   `TestPolynomialEvaluation`: Polynomial evaluation at multiple points (0, 1, 5, 10, 100)
        *   `TestDeterministicPolynomialEvaluation`: Deterministic behavior verification for consensus safety
    *   ✅ **Test Results**: All 381 chain tests + 78 API tests = 459 total tests passing, 0 failures

        *   Sums slot ranges for participating dealers (SlotEndIndex - SlotStartIndex + 1)
        *   Requires >50% slot coverage for successful transition to VERIFYING phase
    *   ✅ **Event Emission**: Proper event emission for both success and failure scenarios:

    *   Reduced network round trips (single query gets all DKG data)
    *   Simplified client logic (no need for separate participant/commitment queries)
    *   Better atomic consistency (all data from same block height)
*   ✅ Ready for task VI.2 implementation (actual query logic)

### VI.2 [x] Chain-Side Querier (`bls` module): Implement `EpochBLSData`
*   Action: Implement the `EpochBLSData` gRPC querier method.

    *   ✅ **DKG Security Enhancement**: Enables consensus-based exclusion of dealers whose shares fail cryptographic verification
    *   ✅ **Malicious Dealer Protection**: Prevents invalid dealers from contributing to final group public key computation

### VI.5 [x] Controller-Side Logic (`decentralized-api`): Verification
*   Action: Implement logic for a controller to verify shares and reconstruct its slot secrets.
*   Location: `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/verifier.go` (new package/file).
*   Logic:
    *   Listen for `EventVerifyingPhaseStarted` or query DKG phase state for `epoch_id`.
    *   If in `VERIFYING` phase and the controller is a participant:
        *   Query the chain for complete epoch data: `blsQueryClient.EpochBLSData(epoch_id)`.
        *   For each slot index `i` in its *own* assigned slot range `[start_m, end_m]`:
            *   Initialize its slot secret share `s_i = 0` (scalar).
            *   For each dealer `P_k` whose parts were successfully submitted (from query response):
                *   Retrieve `P_k`'s commitments (`C_kj`).
                *   Find the encrypted share `encrypted_share_ki_for_m` that `P_k` made for slot `i` intended for this controller `P_m`:
                    *   Find this controller's index in `EpochBLSData.participants`.
                    *   Access `P_k.participant_shares[controller_index].encrypted_shares` array.
                    *   Calculate array index: `slot_offset = i - controller.slot_start_index`.
                    *   Get share: `encrypted_share_ki_for_m = encrypted_shares[slot_offset]`.
                *   Decrypt `encrypted_share_ki_for_m` using Cosmos keyring:
                    *   Use `cosmosClient.DecryptBytes(keyName, encrypted_share_ki_for_m)` or equivalent keyring decrypt method
                    *   The Cosmos keyring handles all ECIES operations internally (ephemeral key extraction, ECDH, key derivation, decryption)
                    *   **Verified Compatible**: Keyring can decrypt dealer-encrypted shares due to unified Cosmos ECIES implementation
                *   This yields the original scalar share `share_ki`.
                *   Verify `share_ki` against `P_k`'s public polynomial commitments (i.e., check `g_scalar_mult(share_ki) == eval_poly_commitments(i, C_kj)`). (Requires BLS library).
                *   If valid, add to its slot secret share: `s_i = (s_i + share_ki) mod q` (where `q` is the BLS scalar field order).
            *   Store the final secret share `s_i` for slot `i` locally (e.g., in memory or secure storage).
        *   After processing all its assigned slots, if all successful, construct and submit `MsgSubmitVerificationVector` to the `bls` module.
*   Files: `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/verifier.go`, `decentralized-api/internal/cosmos/query_client.go` (add method for `EpochBLSData` query), `decentralized-api/internal/cosmos/client.go` (add method to send `MsgSubmitVerificationVector`).

    *   Share verification against G2 commitments using pairing operations
    *   Scalar field arithmetic for share aggregation
    *   Group public key computation from G2 commitments

        *   Current DKG phase is `VERIFYING`.
        *   Current block height is before `verifying_phase_deadline_block`.
        *   Participant has not submitted their vector already.

done for controller post-DKG earlier, ensure consistency).

### VII.2 [ ] Chain-Side Logic (`bls` module): `EndBlocker` for DKG Completion
*   Action: Extend `EndBlocker` logic in `x/bls/abci.go`.
*   Function: `CompleteDKG(ctx sdk.Context, epochBLSData types.EpochBLSData)` (called 
internally from EndBlocker).
*   Logic (in `EndBlocker`):
    *   Iterate through active DKGs.
    *   If DKG is in `VERIFYING` phase and `current_block_height >= 
    verifying_phase_deadline_block`:
        *   Call `CompleteDKG`.
        *   Inside `CompleteDKG`:
            *   Calculate total number of slots covered by actual validator 
            participants who successfully submitted `MsgSubmitVerificationVector`. 
            (Iterate through `EpochBLSData.verification_vectors_submitters`, get their 
            original `BLSParticipantInfo` and sum their slot ranges).
            *   If `sum_covered_slots_verified > EpochBLSData.i_total_slots / 2`:
                *   Initialize `GroupPublicKey` as identity G2 point.
                *   Retrieve the `C_k0` commitment (first commitment, `g * a_k0`) from 
                each dealer `P_k` in `EpochBLSData.dealer_parts` (ensure these dealers 
                were part of the successful set if there was a filter step).
                *   Aggregate these: `GroupPublicKey = sum(C_k0)` (G2 point addition). 
                (Requires BLS library).
                *   Store computed `GroupPublicKey` in `EpochBLSData.group_public_key`.

                *   Update `EpochBLSData.dkg_phase` to `FAILED`.
                *   Store updated `EpochBLSData`.
                *   Emit `EventDKGFailed` (reason: "Insufficient participation in 
                verification phase").
*   Files: `x/bls/abci.go`, `x/bls/keeper/phase_transitions.go` (for `CompleteDKG`).
*   Additional BLS Operations: When implementing group public key computation, use 
`github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto` for G2 point addition to aggregate commitments: 
`GroupPublicKey = sum(C_k0)`.

### VII.3 [ ] Test
*   Action: Unit tests for `CompleteDKG` logic:
    *   Correct deadline check.
    *   Correct calculation of verified slot coverage.
    *   Correct aggregation of `C_k0` commitments to form `GroupPublicKey`.
    *   Correct phase transition to `COMPLETED` and event emission.
    *   Correct phase transition to `FAILED` and event emission.
*   Action: Simulate chain progression in tests to trigger `EndBlocker` for DKG 
completion.
*   Action: Run tests.

## VIII. Step 6: Controller Post-DKG Operations

### VIII.1 [ ] Controller-Side Logic (`decentralized-api`): Storing DKG Results
*   Action: Implement logic for a controller to finalize its DKG state.
*   Location: `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/manager.go` (or similar).
*   Logic:
    *   Listen for `EventGroupPublicKeyGenerated` for the relevant `epoch_id`.
    *   Retrieve and store the `GroupPublicKey`, `I_total_slots`, `t_slots_degree` 
    from the event.
    *   The controller should already have its set of private BLS slot shares `{s_i}` 
    for its assigned slots from Step VI.5. Ensure these are securely stored and 
    associated with the `epoch_id` and `GroupPublicKey`.
    *   The controller is now ready for threshold signing for this epoch.
*   Files: `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/manager.go`, `decentralized-api/
internal/event_listener/listener.go`.

### VIII.2 [ ] Test
*   Action: Controller: Unit tests for handling `EventGroupPublicKeyGenerated` and 
correctly associating its local slot shares with the group public key and epoch 
details.
*   Action: Consider an end-to-end test scenario involving multiple controllers, a 
full DKG cycle, and verification that each participating controller has the correct 
group public key and its respective private shares. This is a larger integration 
effort.
*   Action: Run tests.

### VIII.3 [ ] End-to-End Integration Testing
*   Action: Comprehensive end-to-end testing of complete BLS DKG workflow.
*   Scope: Multi-controller, full DKG cycle testing with real cryptographic operations.
*   **Test Scenarios**:
    *   **Complete DKG Success Flow**:
        *   Multiple controllers (3-5 participants) with real secp256k1 keys
        *   Full epoch transition triggering DKG initiation
        *   All participants acting as dealers (polynomial generation, encryption, submission)
        *   Phase transition to verification with sufficient participation (>50% slots)
        *   All participants performing verification (decryption, cryptographic verification, aggregation)
        *   Successful DKG completion with group public key generation
        *   Controllers storing final DKG results and being ready for threshold signing
    *   **Failure Scenarios**:
        *   Insufficient dealer participation (<50% slots) → DKG failure in dealing phase
        *   Insufficient verifier participation (<50% slots) → DKG failure in verification phase
        *   Invalid shares/commitments → Proper rejection and dealer validity assessment
        *   Deadline violations → Proper phase transitions and failure handling
    *   **Edge Cases**:
        *   Single controller scenarios (100% participation)
        *   Minimal viable participation (exactly >50% threshold)
        *   Large participant sets (10+ controllers) for performance validation
        *   Mixed valid/invalid dealer scenarios for security validation
*   **Validation Points**:
    *   Cryptographic correctness: Share encryption/decryption compatibility
    *   Group public key verification: Proper G2 commitment aggregation
    *   State consistency: Deterministic storage and phase transitions
    *   Event emission: All controllers receive and process events correctly
    *   Error handling: Graceful failure modes and proper error reporting
    *   Performance: Acceptable timing for realistic participant counts
*   **Test Infrastructure**:
    *   Multi-node chain simulation with realistic block progression
    *   Multiple controller instances with independent key management
    *   Real BLS12-381 cryptographic operations (no mocking)
    *   Event listener integration and cross-controller coordination
    *   Comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   Each participating controller has identical group public key
    *   Each controller has correct private slot shares for assigned range
    *   Group public key verifies against aggregated dealer commitments
    *   Controllers ready for threshold signing operations
    *   All failure modes handled gracefully with proper error states
*   Files: 
    *   **TODO**: `tests/integration/bls_dkg_e2e_test.go` (comprehensive test suite)
    *   **TODO**: `tests/integration/helpers/` (test infrastructure and utilities)
    *   **TODO**: Enhanced testing harnesses for multi-controller scenarios

## IX. General Considerations & Libraries

### IX.1 [✅] secp256k1 Key Usage
*   Action: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Achieved unified Cosmos SDK cryptographic ecosystem.
*   Implementation: 
    *   **Dealer Side**: Uses `github.com/decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v4` + `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/crypto/ecies` for encryption
    *   **Verifier Side**: Uses Cosmos keyring (`cosmosClient.DecryptBytes()`) for decryption
    *   **Unified ECIES**: All participants use identical Cosmos SDK ECIES implementation ensuring perfect compatibility
    *   **Verified Standard**: Cosmos SDK ECIES provides the standardized, audited implementation across the ecosystem
    *   **Dependency Cleanup**: Eliminated all Ethereum dependencies - pure Cosmos ecosystem approach
*   **Security Benefits**:
    *   Cosmos SDK's audited cryptographic implementations
    *   Consistent ECIES parameters guaranteed across all participants
    *   Reduced attack surface through unified ecosystem approach

### IX.2 [ ] Error Handling and Logging
*   Action: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the new 
module and controller logic.

### IX.3 [✅] Cryptographic Compatibility Verification
*   Action: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Verified end-to-end cryptographic compatibility between dealer and verifier implementations.
*   Verification Results:
    *   **Perfect Encryption Compatibility**: Dealer (`encryptForParticipant`) ↔ Cosmos keyring decryption verified working
    *   **Identical ECIES Overhead**: Both implementations produce identical 113-byte encryption overhead
    *   **Cross-System Decryption**: Cosmos keyring successfully decrypts dealer-encrypted data
    *   **Security Validation**: Each participant can only decrypt their own shares (proper isolation)
    *   **Performance**: Consistent encryption/decryption performance across implementations
*   Test Coverage:
    *   ✅ `TestKeyringVsDealerEncryption`: Confirms perfect compatibility
    *   ✅ `TestKeyringMultipleParticipants`: Validates proper security isolation
    *   ✅ All BLS DKG tests pass with real cryptographic operations
*   Files: `decentralized-api/internal/bls_dkg/keyring_encrypt_decrypt_test.go`

This plan provides a structured approach. Each major step includes development tasks 
for proto definitions, chain-side logic (keepers, message handlers, queriers, 
EndBlocker), controller-side logic, and testing. Remember to iterate and refine as 
development progresses.

NOTE: Deterministic Storage Considerations
*   **Issue**: Golang maps have non-deterministic iteration order, which can cause 
consensus failures when stored in blockchain state.
*   **Solution**: All data structures stored in state use deterministic `repeated` 
arrays instead of `map` fields.
