# Preparing the join docker images
The gist of this can be found in `test2.sh`, but here are the steps:

1. Build the genesis docker image, using the Makefile command build-genesis.
1. This will use DockerfileGenesis to build the image.
1. The image, when launched in a container, will run `init-docker-genesis.sh`, which will:
    1. Initialize the genesis node with the correct settings.
    1. Create and add a genesis account.
    1. Launch the chain
1. Now build the api docker image, using the Makefile `release-docker` in `decentralized-api`
1. Launch the api docker image, being sure that KEY_NAME is set to "genesis"
1. Now you can use files generated by the genesis node to create files in `./inference-chain/build`:
    1. `genesis.json` - this is found on the docker container at `/root/.inference/config`
    1. `inferenced` - this is the executable built by the Makefile, it should already be in `./inference-chain/build`
    1. `config.env` - This has two important values:
        1. SEEDS - This is the address of the genesis node (at a minimum), in the format of {{node_id}}@{{node-ip-address}}:{{port}}
            1. The node_id is retrieved by running `inferenced tendermint show-node-id`
            1. The ip address needs to be a public URL or IP address.
            1. The port is usually 26656
        1. ADD_ENDPOINT - This is the address of the API for the genesis node, which you launched previously. Again, this will need to be available publicly on the internet.
