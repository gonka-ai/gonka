# Upgrade Strategy for Cosmos Blockchain App Using Cosmovisor

## Overview
Our upgrade strategy for the Cosmos blockchain app relies on **Cosmovisor**, a widely used tool in Cosmos environments. Cosmovisor acts as a wrapper around application binaries, monitoring chain events and managing upgrades automatically.

### How Cosmovisor Works:
1. **Event Monitoring**: Cosmovisor listens for chain events and checks the `upgrade-info.json` file in the data directory.
2. **Upgrade Detection**: When the app exits, Cosmovisor reads the `upgrade-info.json` file for details such as:
    - Upgrade name
    - Target chain height
    - URL for the new binaries
3. **Binary Download**: It fetches the specified binaries and relaunches the app using the new binaries with the same arguments.

This approach is central to our strategy for managing application binaries.

## Special Considerations

### Dual Binary Management
Since our system includes two binaries (chain app and decentralized API), we needed to adapt the process for seamless upgrades:

1. **Build Process**:
    - Use the `build-for-upgrade` target in the makefiles for both the chain and API.
    - The process generates a build using Docker, captures the output, and packages it into a zip file.
    - The files are published to the directories `public_html/v2/dapi` for the decentralized API and `public_html/v2/inferenced` for the chain binary.
    - The SHA of each build is printed to use in the URL.

2. **Governance Proposal**:
    - A governance proposal includes the JSON information about binaries and their SHA.
    - The proposal is submitted and voted on.
    - Once approved, the upgrade details are added to `upgrade-info.json`. Cosmovisor downloads and installs the upgrade.

3. **Scalability Considerations**:
    - The binaries must be hosted in a manner that supports a high volume of simultaneous downloads during the upgrade process.

## Upgrade Workflow

1. **Chain-Specific Upgrade Handlers**:
    - Add the actual upgrade handler to the chain to manage data migrations or other state updates.
    - Look in the `inference-chain/app/upgrades` folder and the `inference-chain/app/upgrades.go` file for examples
    - Key elements include:
        - Constants defining the upgrade name (in `constants.go`).
        - A `CreateUpgradeHandler` function.
        - Invocation in `setupUpgradeHandlers` (found in `upgrades.go`).
        - If the upgrade changes the data in the state, increment `ConsensusVersion` in `module.go`

2. **Build the Binaries**:
    - Generate and publish binaries with the `build-for-upgrade` Makefile target.
    - Ensure appropriate versioning and SHAs.
    - Document the changes clearly.

3. **Submit Governance Proposal**:
    - Include upgrade details such as binaries, SHAs, and hosting URLs.
      Example command line to submit:
   ```
   inferenced tx upgrade software-upgrade v0.0.2test --title v0.0.2test --upgrade-height 74 --upgrade-info {"binaries":{"linux/amd64":"http://binary-server/v2/inferenced/inferenced.zip?checksum=sha256:32620280f4b6abe013e97a521ae48f1c6915c78a51cc6661c51c429951fe6032"},"api_binaries":{"linux/amd64":"http://binary-server/v2/dapi/decentralized-api.zip?checksum=sha256:06ba4bb537ce5e139edbd4ffdac5d68acc5e5bc1da89b4989f12c5fe1919118b"}} --summary For testing --deposit 100000icoin --from cosmos1jz6smxmljlr4yqymf7lw5qcfuvw700w2g663vp --keyring-backend test --chain-id=prod-sim --keyring-dir=/root/.inference --yes --broadcast-mode sync --output json
   ```

4. **Promote the Proposal**:
    - Allow stakeholders to test the binaries.
    - Provide documentation and tools for validating and describing the changes.

5. **Monitor the Rollout**:
    - Upon governance approval, the upgrade will be scheduled for the `upgrade-height`
    - Monitor the network disruption during rollout as nodes update simultaneously and download the binaries.

## Upgrading Data in the Chain
The recommended approach for upgrading data is illustrated in PR 84:

https://github.com/product-science/inference-ignite/pull/84

#### Summary:
1. Copy the unmodified .proto files for the data you are changing. Rename them with a V1 in front (or V2 if there is already a V1)
2. Change the original proto files to whatever new format we want
3. Write a custom getter for the OLD values (V1)
4. Register a change handler that gets the old values and then writes the new ones. This may involve:
   1. Converting values from one type to another
   2. Dropping fields
   3. Adding new fields and coming up with a decent default value
   4. Any other necessary change, as long as the new values can be derived from old ones.

## Testing the Upgrade Mechanism (not specific upgrades)
Testing is semi-automated, with plans for further automation.

### Steps:
1. Update `constants.go`:
    - Set the version to `v0.0.1-test`.
2. Build and launch the app. (locally, as you would for Testermint)
3. Update the version to `v0.0.2-test` in `constants.go`.
4. Rebuild using `build-for-upgrade`.
    - Outputs are stored in the correct directory, and SHAs are output during the build.
5. Run `submit upgrade` test:
    - Change the SHAs in the Testermint test.
    - Run tests to ensure successful version upgrades.

## Testing the Upgrade Mechanism (for specific upgrades)
Testing is similar to above, but with several additional steps:
1. You will need TWO branches synced to your local machine: One for the new version you are migrating to, one for the commit to upgrade FROM.
2. Make the changes in the new branch and write the upgrade handler per instructions above.
3. Make sure the new binaries will pass the tests in the new branch
3. Build the new binaries using `build-for-upgrade`. (both in decentralized-api and inference-chain)
4. Copy the new binaries (zip files) to the OLD binares directory (public-html/v2/dapi and public-html/v2/inferenced)
4. In the OLD branch open the `submit upgrade` Testermint test, make sure the parameters and SHA match the NEW branch values.
5. Launch the chain in the OLD branch
6. Run the submit upgrade test.
7. If it passes, run `make build-docker` in the NEW branch, to ensure the image matches the new binaries.
8. Run tests needed to verify the upgrade went well (will depend on the upgrade). Be careful not to run tests that will reboot the chain.
## Key Notes
- **Upgrade Handlers**: Each upgrade requires a tailored handler for any necessary migrations.
- **Documentation**: Ensure clear communication of changes and steps for stakeholders.
- **Scalability**: Account for possible high traffic during binary downloads.
