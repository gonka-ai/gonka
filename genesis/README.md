# Gonka Genesis Ceremony

The genesis ceremony is a coordinated process to bootstrap the Gonka blockchain with a pre-defined set of initial validators and an agreed-upon genesis.json file.   
This ceremony is important because it establishes the network's foundational security, ensures fair participation among validators, and creates a verifiable starting point for the blockchain.

## Overview

The ceremony is a transparent and auditable process managed entirely through GitHub Pull Requests (PRs). The core workflow is straightforward:

- Participants (Validators) submit information and offline transaction files (GENTX and GENPARTICIPANT) via PRs
- The Coordinator aggregates and verifies these inputs to publish the final, agreed `genesis.json` with a scheduled `genesis_time` and recorded hash.
- Validators verify that the file is produced correctly and launch their nodes

The ceremony proceeds through clearly defined phases to produce an auditable, shared `genesis.json`. All collaboration happens via GitHub PRs for full transparency and accountability.


This process is guided by several key principles:

- **Transparency and Auditability:** Using GitHub PRs for all submissions creates a public, verifiable record of the entire process from start to finish.

- **Decentralized Launch:** The ceremony ensures the network begins with an agreed-upon set of independent validators, establishing decentralization from block zero.

- **Verifiable State:** The final genesis.json hash is recorded, allowing every participant to confirm they are starting from the exact same initial state.

- **Consensus:** The process guarantees that all initial validators have reviewed and accepted the genesis state before the network goes live.

## Prerequisites

Before participating in the ceremony, each participant (validator) must:

1. **Fork** [the Gonka Repository](https://github.com/gonka-ai/gonka/) to your GitHub account

2. **Choose a participant (validator) name** and create your validator directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r genesis/validators/template genesis/validators/<YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>
   ```
   This directory will be used for sharing information and transactions during the ceremony.

3. **Follow the local setup portion of the Quickstart Guide**. Before the ceremony, you must complete the local machine setup as described in the [Gonka Quickstart](https://gonka.ai/participant/quickstart) guide. This includes installing the `inferenced` CLI, creating your Account Cold Key, and pulling the Docker images. **Stop** after pulling the images and do not launch the services; the ceremony process replaces the server-side setup and on-chain transactions with an offline, PR-based workflow.

4. Confirm readiness:
   - `inferenced` CLI is installed locally and your Account Cold Key is created
   - Containers are pulled, models downloaded, and environment variables (`config.env`) are configured


## Ceremony Process

The ceremony follows a 5-phase process, replacing the on-chain registration steps from `quickstart.md` with an offline, PR-based workflow. All transaction files are generated locally and submitted for aggregation by the Coordinator.

- **Phase 1 [Validators]**: Prepare Keys and initial server setup; open PR with validator information (including node ID, ML operational address, and consensus pubkey)
- **Phase 2 [Coordinator]**: Aggregate validator info and publish `genesis.json` draft for review
- **Phase 3 [Validators]**: Generate offline `GENTX` and `GENPARTICIPANT` files from the draft; open PR with files
- **Phase 4 [Coordinator]**: Verify and collect transactions, patch `genesis.json`, set `genesis_time`
- **Phase 5 [Validators]**: Retrieve final `genesis.json`, verify hash, and launch nodes before `genesis_time`

### Deploy Scripts

To simplify the process, the deploy scripts for the Ceremony will be in [/deploy/join](/deploy/join) directory of [the Gonka Repository](https://github.com/gonka-ai/gonka/).  
The deploy scripts are the same as the standard join flow from `quickstart.md`. During the ceremony, the Coordinator will adjust the following environment variables to enable genesis-specific behavior:

- `INIT_ONLY` — initialize data directories and prepare configs without starting the full stack
- `GENESIS_SEEDS` — seed node address list used for initial P2P connectivity at launch
- `IS_GENESIS` — toggle genesis-only paths (e.g., hash verification, bootstrap behavior) in compose/scripts

Location: these variables are set by the Coordinator in `deploy/join/docker-compose.yml`. Validators should not change them.

Once **Phase 5** is finished and the chain has launched, the variables above are removed from the repo by the Coordinator as they're not required further.

Working directory: run all `docker compose` commands from `deploy/join` (change directory first), or pass `-f deploy/join/docker-compose.yml` explicitly when running from the repository root.

### 1. [Validators]: Prepare Keys and Initial Server Setup

This phase mirrors the key generation steps in `quickstart.md`, but all setup is performed offline to generate files for the ceremony. The Account Key (Cold) was already created during the quickstart; the following steps will guide you through generating the ML Operational Key (Warm) on your server.

#### 1.1 [Local] Confirm Account Cold Key (from Quickstart)
The Account Cold Key was created during `quickstart.md`. You can view its information with:
```bash
./inferenced keys list --keyring-backend file
```

**Example output:**
```
Enter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):
- address: gonka1eq4f5p32ewkekf9rv5f0qjsa0xaepckmgl85kr
  name: "gonka-account-key"
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A4U3G2eY46mwhWx7ZXieT+LetPJhG0jHNuVCQB6wgBZK"}'
  type: local
```

#### 1.2 [Server]: Initialize Node and Get Node ID
```bash
docker compose run --rm node
```

**Example output:**
```
51a9df752b60f565fe061a115b6494782447dc1f
```


#### 1.3 [Server]: Extract Consensus Public Key
Start the `tmkms` service to generate the consensus key, then extract the public key.
```bash
docker compose up -d tmkms && docker compose run --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh tmkms -c "tmkms-pubkey"
```

**Example output:**
```
/wTVavYr5OCiVssIT3Gc5nsfIH0lP1Rqn/zeQtq4CvQ=
```

#### 1.4 [Server]: Generate ML Operational Key

Create the warm key inside the `api` container using the `file` keyring backend (required for programmatic access). The key will be stored in a persistent volume mapped to `/root/.inference` of the container:

Note: `$KEY_NAME` and `$KEYRING_PASSWORD` are defined in Quickstart `config.env`.
```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -it api /bin/sh
```

Inside the container, create the ML operational key:
```bash
printf '%s\n%s\n' "$KEYRING_PASSWORD" "$KEYRING_PASSWORD" | inferenced keys add "$KEY_NAME" --keyring-backend file
```

**Example output:**
```
~ # printf '%s\n%s\n' "$KEYRING_PASSWORD" "$KEYRING_PASSWORD" | inferenced keys add "$KEY_NAME" --keyring-backend file

- address: gonka1gyz2agg5yx49gy2z4qpsz9826t6s9xev6tkehw
  name: node-702105
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Ao8VPh5U5XQBcJ6qxAIwBbhF/3UPZEwzZ9H/qbIA6ipj"}'
  type: local

```

#### 1.5 [Local]: Prepare PR with validator information
Create or update `genesis/validators/<YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>/README.md` with the following fields. Use values collected above and from Quickstart.

```markdown
Account Public Key: <value of ACCOUNT_PUBKEY from your config.env file>
Node ID: <node-id-from-step-1.2>
ML Operational Address: <ml-operational-key-address-from-step-1.4>
Consensus Public Key: <consensus-pubkey-from-step-1.3>
P2P_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS: <value of P2P_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS from your config.env file>
```

#### 1.6 Create Pull Request

Submit a PR to [the Gonka Repository](https://github.com/gonka-ai/gonka/) with your validator information. Include a clear title like "Add validator: <YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>" and ensure all required fields are populated in your README.md file.

### 2. [Coordinator]: Genesis Draft Preparation

The coordinator will:
- Review and merge all validator PRs from Phase 1
- Prepare the initial `genesis.json` draft which includes all Account Addresses and place it in `genesis/genesis-draft.json`
- Announce the availability of the draft to all participants

### 3. [Validators]: GENTX and GENPARTICIPANT Generation

This phase involves generating the necessary transaction files for chain initialization. These transactions include:

- `MsgCreateValidator` - Creates your validator on the chain
- `MsgSubmitNewParticipant` - Registers your node as a network participant

The gentx command requires the following variables from previous steps:

- `<cold key name>` - name of Account Cold Key in local registry (e.g., "gonka-account-key" from Quickstart)
- `<YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>` - the validator name chosen in the Prerequisites section
- `<ml-operational-key-address-from-step-1.4>` - address of ML Operational Key from step 1.4
- `$PUBLIC_URL` - environment variable with public URL from Quickstart's `config.env`
- `<consensus-pubkey-from-step-1.3>` - consensus public key from step 1.3
- `<node-id-from-step-1.2>` - node ID from step 1.2

This custom `gentx` command automatically creates the required `authz` grants from your Account Key to your ML Operational Key, simplifying the setup process.

Before generating files, you must copy the draft `genesis/genesis-draft.json` into the `config` directory where your Account Cold Key is stored. This allows the `gentx` command to access your key and validate the transaction against the correct chain configuration.

The default home directory for `inferenced` is `~/.inference`. If you created your key there, use the following command:

```bash
cp ./genesis/genesis-draft.json ~/.inference/config/genesis.json
```

*If you specified a custom home directory with the `--home` flag when creating your key, be sure to use that same directory for the `gentx` command by providing the `--home` flag again.*

#### [Local]: Create GENTX and GENPARTICIPANT Files

The `1nicoin` value represents an artificial consensus weight for the genesis transaction. The real validator weight will be determined during the first Proof of Compute (PoC) phase.

```bash
./inferenced genesis gentx \
    --keyring-backend file \
    <cold key name> 1nicoin \
    --moniker <YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME> \
    --pubkey <consensus-pubkey-from-step-1.3> \
    --ml-operational-address <ml-operational-key-address-from-step-1.4> \
    --url $PUBLIC_URL \
    --chain-id gonka-rehearsal \
    --node-id <node-id-from-step-1.2>
```

**Example output:**
```
./inferenced genesis gentx \
    --home ./702121 \
    --keyring-backend file \
    702121 1nicoin \
    --pubkey eNrjtkSXzfE18jq3lqvpu/i1iIog9SN+kqR2Wsa6fSM= \
    --ml-operational-address gonka13xplq68fws3uvs8m7ej2ed5ack9hzpc68fwvex \
    --url http://36.189.234.237:19238 \
    --moniker "mynode-702121" --chain-id gonka-rehearsal \
    --node-id 149d25924b9a6676448aea716864c31775645459
Enter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):
Classic genesis transaction written to "702121/config/gentx/gentx-149d25924b9a6676448aea716864c31775645459.json"
Genparticipant transaction written to "702121/config/genparticipant/genparticipant-149d25924b9a6676448aea716864c31775645459.json"
```

#### [Local]: Submit Generated Files

Copy the generated files to your validator directory and create a PR:

1. Copy files to your validator directory:

   ```bash
   cp ~/.inference/config/gentx/gentx-<node-id>.json genesis/validators/<YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>/
   cp ~/.inference/config/genparticipant/genparticipant-<node-id>.json genesis/validators/<YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>/
   ```

2. Create a PR with the following files:

   - `genesis/validators/<YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>/gentx-<node-id-from-step-1.2>.json`
   - `genesis/validators/<YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>/genparticipant-<node-id-from-step-1.2>.json`

Use a clear PR title like "Add gentx files for validator: <YOUR_VALIDATOR_NAME>".


### 4. [Coordinator]: Final Genesis Preparation

Once all validators have submitted their transaction files, the Coordinator begins constructing the official `genesis.json`. This critical step ensures all initial participants are correctly included in the blockchain's state from the very first block.

The process involves two main commands:
1.  **Collecting Genesis Transactions**: The `collect-gentxs` command gathers all `gentx-<node-id>.json` files, validates them, and incorporates them into `genesis.json` to populate the initial validator set.
2.  **Patching Participant Data**: The `patch-genesis` command processes the `genparticipant-<node-id>.json` files, verifying their signatures and patching the initial state to include all registered participants.

After merging all transactions, the Coordinator sets the `genesis_time` to a future timestamp, ensuring all validators have enough time to prepare for a synchronized launch.

Finally, the Coordinator commits the official `genesis.json` to the `genesis/` directory. The hash of this commit is then embedded into the source code to ensure all nodes start from the same verified state.

#### [Coordinator Local]: Collect Genesis Transactions

```bash
./inferenced genesis collect-gentxs --gentx-dir gentxs
```

#### [Coordinator]: Process Participant Registrations

```bash
./inferenced genesis patch-genesis --genparticipant-dir genparticipants
```

#### [Coordinator]: Configure Network Seeds

The Coordinator configures the initial network peering by setting the `GENESIS_SEEDS` variable in `deploy/join/docker-compose.yml`. This variable is a comma-separated list of validator node addresses, constructed using the `Node ID` and `P2P_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS` provided by each validator in their respective `README.md` files.

Example format: `<node-id-1>@<P2P_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_1>,<node-id-2>@<P2P_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_2>,...`

Additionally, the Coordinator sets `INIT_ONLY` to `false`, which allows the nodes to fully start up and connect to the network at launch time instead of just initializing their data directories.

### 5. [Validators]: Chain Launch

With the final `genesis.json` published, validators must verify that it is produced correctly and prepare their nodes to launch at the specified `genesis_time`. The blockchain will begin producing blocks at exactly this moment.

#### 5.1 [Server]: Update and Launch

These steps should be performed on your validator server.

1.  **Pull Latest Configuration**

    Pull the latest changes from the repository to get the final `genesis.json` and seed node configuration.
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Update Container Images**

    From the `deploy/join` directory, pull the latest Docker container images. The node image is built with the final genesis hash for verification.
    ```bash
    source config.env
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mlnode.yml pull
    ```

3.  **Launch Your Validator**

    Finally, start all services.
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mlnode.yml up -d
    ```

#### 5.2 [Server]: Verify Launch Status

After launching, monitor your node's logs to confirm it is waiting for the genesis time:

```bash
docker compose logs node -f
```

Look for a message similar to this:
```
INF Genesis time is in the future. Sleeping until then... genTime=2025-08-14T09:13:39Z module=server
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `api` container may restart several times before the `node` container is fully operational
- Once the genesis time passes, you should see block production messages in the logs

### 6. [Coordinator]: Post-Launch Cleanup

Remove genesis-specific variables from docker-compose.yml configuration files to transition to normal operation mode.
